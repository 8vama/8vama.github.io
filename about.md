My name is Eva Ma, a senior studying Computer Science at Rice University. I am super passionate about product and data engineering. I interned at Airbnb for the past summer and built a canary pipeline for integration testing for our financial reporting system. I've also been a TA for a while now, and my favorite ones are algorithmic thinking, tools & models in data science.

Besides CS, I'm also curious about contemporary art, anthropology, and philosophy. I spent quite a bit of my time exploring different disciplines. I love exploring all the museums around the world and learning about different communities and societies. I put my thoughts into photography and writings.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite <a href="http://reddit.com" target="blank">subreddit</a>. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture "prof_pic.jpg" and put it in the img folder. 

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="blank">Font Awesome icons</a>, like the ones below. Add your facebook, twitter, linkedin, or just disable all of them.
